### Description
Data are created and collected all around us, trails left from interactions in social media, accessible through streams, feeds, APIs, and data-stores. These data are used to power a growing number of services, modeled not only off our own interactions but also interactions of our friends and larger network of connections. Even if well intended, the growing range of uses of systems that algorithmically ingest our data means there are a growing number of unintended consequences and inherent biases. In order to untangle some of these issues, we’ll dive into the literature, while running our own data analyses on captured surveillance data, from system logs, and NYPD datasets to mobile phone logs.

This is an advanced technical class. There will be a mandatory tutorial session beforehand. You are expected to be proficient in the Python programming language before the start of the class. We will hit the ground running, and move aggressively fast. We will use the iPython notebook environment, and get to know libraries such as: Pandas for time series analysis, NLTK for Natural Language Processing, and Scikit-learn for some Machine Learning. We’ll also learn to leverage existing API’s to enhance our datasets and models. There will be both reading and coding assignments every week. Your final projects will be group based.

### Logistics
- Class: Mondays, 9am-12pm
- Office Hours: by request 30 minutes before or after class (or via skype)
- Assignments:
    - _Reading_:
        - Each week, there will be some form of reading. We are keeping the reading short and accessible so please do it.
        - The required readings are available via Dropbox or through an online link, as indicated in the assignment section of each week.
        - We recommend acquiring a copy of ["Data Science from Scratch"] (http://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/149190142X) as a supplemental resource for all technical topics covered in class.
    - _Coding_:
        - We'll use a shared dropbox folder for submitting coding homework assignments.
- Evaluation:
  - On-time attendance and class participation: 25%
  - Assignments: 25%
  - Mid-term Bot Project: 25%
  - Final Project: 25%
  - _Note: Showing up more than 10 minutes late without prior notice is an unexcused absence. More than 2 unexcused absences results in automatic failure._
